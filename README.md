Please be aware that when using 'ionic serve,' some native features and properties may not function as expected. To ensure proper functionality, it is recommended using Android Studio for a more seamless experience with the emulator, as it provides better support for native properties.

Install Android Studio

```
Before you can use the emulator, you may need to configure certain settings in Android Studio.

Once the emulator is properly configured in Android Studio, follow these steps: Open the terminal, ensure that it's set to the app folder, and execute the following command as it may be required on the first run:
```bash
  ionic capacitor build android
```
To run a live preview on the android emulator or device:
```bash
  ionic capacitor run android -l --external
```
